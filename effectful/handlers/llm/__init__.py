"""LLM-implemented functions via algebraic effects.

`effectful.handlers.llm` lets you write Python functions whose bodies are
implemented by a large language model, and call them like ordinary code.

## Core concepts

- **`Template`** — a fully type-annotated Python function whose body is `raise
  NotHandled` and whose docstring is a [format
  string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax)
  prompt. Calling a template (under a provider) formats its arguments into the
  prompt, invokes the model, and decodes the response to the template's declared
  return type. Define one with the `Template.define` decorator.

- **`Tool`** — a normal Python callable exposed to the model. Its signature and
  docstring become the schema the model sees; the model calls it by name with
  JSON arguments and receives the encoded result. Tools in a template's lexical
  scope are offered to the model automatically; because scope is ordinary Python
  scope, an `Agent` (or an enclosing function) naturally partitions tools and
  templates into disjoint sets. Define one with `Tool.define`.

- **`Agent`** — a class mixin giving each instance a persistent message history,
  so its `Template` methods accumulate conversation context across calls.
  Instance attributes are available in prompts via `{self.attr}`.

- **`Encodable`** — the type-driven JSON bridge used internally to encode Python
  values into the model's context and decode the model's output (structured
  return values and tool-call arguments) back into typed Python objects.

## Tool calling and structured output

During a template call the model may take multiple turns: on each turn it can
call any `Tool` in scope (results are fed back and the loop continues) or
produce a final answer. The final answer is decoded to the template's return
type via constrained/structured generation, so non-`str` return types (ints,
dataclasses, etc.) come back as real Python values. A `FinalTool` lets the model
"answer" by calling a tool whose return value becomes the result and terminates
the loop.

## Providers and handlers

Execution is controlled by composing handlers with
`effectful.ops.semantics.handler(...)`: a provider such as
`effectful.handlers.llm.completions.LiteLLMProvider` implements the model calls,
and helpers like `RetryLLMHandler` add reliability behavior. Because everything
is an algebraic effect, behavior (model requests, tool dispatch, history) can be
observed, logged, or overridden by installing additional handlers.
