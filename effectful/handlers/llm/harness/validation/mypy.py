"""Type checking of generated code by shelling out to mypy.

`MypyTypeChecker` is independent of any executor: it says how generated code is
*checked*, not how it is parsed, compiled or run, so it is installed alongside
whichever of those handlers a stack uses::

    handler(MypyTypeChecker()), handler(BuiltinExecutor())

rather than being part of one.

It is interchangeable with
`~effectful.handlers.llm.harness.validation.ty.TyTypeChecker`, which implements
the same operation with the same contract and is substantially faster; that
module's docstring compares the two.
