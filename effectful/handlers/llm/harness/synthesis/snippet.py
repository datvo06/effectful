"""A persistent, stateful Python REPL offered to the model as a tool.

`StatefulReplSynthesizer` is off by default; install it where the LLM should be
able to run code whose state -- variables, imports, definitions -- survives
across tool calls within a single Skill invocation.

Scoping mirrors how ``__history__`` is managed for Skill calls: `call_agent`
introduces fresh session-bound handlers (`exec_code`, `repl_history`,
`repl_env`) for the duration of the call, and `call_assistant` injects the tool
routed to that session. The session is therefore introduced
and eliminated by its own handler, bounded to the Skill call by construction --
there is no global registry of sessions, and nested Skill calls get their own
isolated ones.

That bound is the fact the model most needs and is least able to infer. It sees
one conversation, in which an `Agent`'s earlier calls are still visible as
earlier user messages, and nothing in the transcript distinguishes "a session
opened here" from "a turn happened here". So the handler states it twice: once
in general, in the class docstring that becomes its system-prompt section, and
once concretely, in the ``REPL session`` section `call_user` attaches to every
request -- which is also where the call's arguments are claimed as session
bindings, since they appear in no table of the system message.

The session is seeded from the Skill's lexical context and routes execution
through the `parse`/`compile`/`exec` effect operations, so it works under any
installed eval provider
(`~effectful.handlers.llm.harness.execution.builtin.BuiltinExecutor` or
`~effectful.handlers.llm.harness.execution.restricted.RestrictedPythonExecutor`).

    """Splice REPL code -- ``generated`` -- into the anchor Skill's body, in its
    real module source, and return the modified source with the ``[lo, hi]`` line
    span of the spliced statements.

    ``generated`` is the cumulative session code (any already-run snippets followed
    by the current one; the caller prepends them). It becomes the Skill function's
    body at its real (possibly nested) position, so the Skill's parameters and
    enclosing scope -- i.e. the session's seed env -- are in scope and each statement
    sees the ones before it (they are function locals). No ``return`` is appended;
    the REPL code doesn't produce the Skill's declared type, and that contract is
    waived by ``lenient`` type checking.

    Only the current snippet is *reported*: ``first_new_stmt`` is its index in
    ``generated.body``, and the region starts there rather than at the body's first
    statement. The earlier snippets are still spliced, because their bindings are
    what the current one reads -- but they must not be diagnosed again, and not
    merely because they already passed. A function body is a stricter scope than the
    session it stands in for: the session is one namespace, seeded with the enclosing
    scope, where rebinding a seeded name is an ordinary assignment. Spliced into a
    function, that same assignment makes the name *local to the whole body*, so a
    snippet that read the seeded value before it -- and ran fine -- becomes a
    use-before-assignment the moment a later snippet writes to it. Reporting only
    the new statements keeps that artifact of the model out of the diagnostics.
    (It survives in one narrow form: a single snippet that reads a seeded name and
    then rebinds it is diagnosed, though the session would run it.)

    Example. For the Skill ::

        @Skill.define
        def analyze(data: list[int]) -> str:
            '''Analyze {data}.'''

    a ``generated`` module of accumulated session statements ::

        total = sum(data)
        print(total / len(data))

    becomes the Skill's body ::

        @Skill.define
        def analyze(data: list[int]) -> str:
            total = sum(data)
            print(total / len(data))

    so each statement sees the Skill's ``data`` and the earlier statements'
    bindings (here ``total``).

    The caller decides whether there is anything to splice at all: it skips this
    when the Skill's source can't be recovered -- a Skill defined at a REPL, in a
    notebook, or via ``exec()`` is sourceless, so the code runs unchecked, exactly
    as ``splice_into_source`` does for a sourceless Callable anchor -- and when the
    snippet contributes no statements to report on. Raises ``RuntimeError`` only on
    source *drift* (source recovered but the def no longer sits where it was
    compiled from), which ``_recover_skill_def`` surfaces.
