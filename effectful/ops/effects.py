"""Effect-row inference — the ``ε`` engine.

Sibling of :func:`effectful.ops.semantics.typeof` / :func:`fvsof`: a fold over the
universal ``apply`` operation that computes which operations a term performs (its
**effect row**), plus the ``Uses`` / ``Computation`` / ``Requires`` annotations that
operations declare and the fold reads.

The per-op rule and its annotation live on the core types, mirroring the ``τ`` / ``fvs``
machinery exactly:

======================  =====================================================
symbol                  home
======================  =====================================================
``Operation.__uses_rule__``   ``ops/types.py``, a ``@final`` method next to ``__type_rule__`` / ``__fvs_rule__``
``Uses``                    ``ops/syntax.py``, next to ``Scoped`` (read by ``__uses_rule__``)
``usesof`` / ``effectsof``   this module (fold, next to ``typeof`` / ``fvsof`` in spirit)
``Computation`` / ``Requires``   this module; argument annotations read by the fold
======================  =====================================================

Like ``Uses``, ``Computation`` and ``Requires`` are plain *read*-metadata, not
:class:`~effectful.ops.types.Annotation` signature-transforms: enforcement is at
``usesof``-time (``_fold_computation_args`` fails loudly on an unclassified callable), so
there is no build-time ``infer_annotations`` gate to wire.

The static LLM tool-governance layer (``toolsof`` / ``reachable_tools`` / ``check_tools``
— transitive tool-graph reachability with no LLM call) is built on top of this in
``handlers/llm/governance.py``.

**Not yet implemented:** ``usagesof`` (usage multiset) and handler discharge; polymorphic
``Operation[[A], B]`` ``Uses`` members; and the *runtime* LLM tool-governance layer — tool
**restriction** as an off-by-default handler filtering the offered tool set (which must
leave synthetic ``LexicalReaders`` tools untouched — they are prompt-variable plumbing,
not effectful tools), a decode-time ``ε`` validator, and ``tool_choice`` forcing. This
module is the ``ε`` core (fold + argument annotations).

    fold correctly.

    It is a **best-effort tripwire, not a soundness guarantee.** Inspection that goes
    through the *type*-level special-method (dunder) protocol — operators (``x + 1``,
    ``x == 0``, ``x < y``), ``len``, ``bool``, calling (``x()``), *missing*-attribute access
    (``x.field``), iteration, indexing, formatting — is bound to :func:`_refuse` and raises
    :class:`UnsoundCallbackFold` *loudly*. But several checks bypass this protocol and
    **cannot** be intercepted (a blanket ``__getattribute__`` override would also break the
    fold's own ``isinstance(arg, Operation)`` dispatch), so a callback branching on them
    silently under-approximates: object **identity** (``x is None``, ``id(x)``), the **type**
    builtins (``type(x)``, ``isinstance(x, …)``, and ``callable(x)`` — which reads the
    ``__call__`` bound below and so is always ``True``), and access to an **existing**
    attribute (``x.__class__``). These are the general precondition restated — the fold is a
    path-insensitive over-approximation of the *reified* term, so a callback doing native
    control flow on its argument violates the precondition regardless. The tripwire catches
    the dunder-protocol cases; the rest are the caller's responsibility: keep callbacks
    straight-line — pass the argument to operations, don't inspect it. See
